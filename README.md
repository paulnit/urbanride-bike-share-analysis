## 🧹 SQL Data Cleaning

The raw trip data was cleaned using SQL:
- Removed null values and ride_id duplicates
- Removed trips <1 minute or >24 hours
- Extracted:  
  - `trip_duration_mins`  
  - `day_of_week`, `month`, `hour_of_day`

🧾 Final dataset: `updatedlast.csv`

- Compares casual vs member ride times


### 2. 📅 Monthly Ride Trends
- Reveals seasonal ridership patterns

### 3. 📆 Ride Distribution by Day of Week
- Which days see the most rides
